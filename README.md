🌍 Roava – Your AI Travel Buddy

Planning a trip can be overwhelming, searching for things to do, figuring out what’s nearby, and trying not to waste time crisscrossing a city. Roava does that heavy lifting for you.

You give us:
	•	A city
	•	Your travel dates
	•	Your pace (chill, normal, fast)
	•	Your interests (museums, food, views, etc.)

Roava brings back a list of real points of interest, then asks Google Gemini AI to turn them into a safe, smart, day-by-day itinerary just for you.
